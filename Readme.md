# How to use external dictionaries to check spelling (SpellCheckerHelper technique)


<p>This example illustrates the use of external OpenOffice dictionaries for German language to check spelling of the TextBox content. The <strong>SpellCheckerHelper</strong> object provides access to the spell checker. <br />
The dictionary has been converted to UTF-8 prior to use because SilverLight technology does not allow encodings other than UTF-8 and Unicode. To convert a dictionary, you can use the utility attached to the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/K18404">K18404</a> article.<br />
Note: when adding new dictionaries to this project, do not forget to specify for them Compile Action = Content.</p><p><i>NB</i>: <strong>DevExpress.XtraRichEdit.Commands.SpellCheckerHelper</strong> class is obsolete starting with version v2010 vol.2 . For a recommended technique, review the following article:<br />
